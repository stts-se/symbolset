/*Package mapper is used to map between different phonetic symbol sets, such as NST-SAMPA to Wikispeech-SAMPA, IPA to SAMPA, and so on. (Documentation on symbol sets can be found in the parent package 'symbolset'.)

By using each symbol set's IPA definition, it is possible to map between symbol sets that share the same list of IPA symbols (or if the left hand symbol is a subset of the right hand symbol set).
